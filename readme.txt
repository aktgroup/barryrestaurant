+1

📈 Fighting the 3-Month Slump (Client Retention)
VIP Phone ID System: Tracks customers by phone number to identify and reward loyal "VIPs".

Loyalty Engine: Implements a "$10 = 1 Point" system where 25 points earns a $10 Reward, incentivizing repeat visits during slow months.

Promo Text Generator: Quickly creates marketing messages for community events to drive foot traffic.

💸 Inflation & Profit Management
Dual-Ledger System: Separates Sales (Money In) from Bulk Expenses (Money Out) to provide a clear view of real-time cash position.

Margin Analysis: Helps the owner identify when rising ingredient costs (inflation) require a menu price adjustment to protect the family's income.

Stock Control: Tracks inventory quantities and generates a PDF Shopping List for items that reach low levels (Qty 1 or less).

🛡️ Future Equipment Funding (The IUL Strategy)
Automated Savings: The system automatically calculates a 15% contribution from every sale toward a Future Equipment Fund (IUL).

Goal Tracking: This helps the business owner save for modern kitchen equipment without relying on high-interest bank loans, aligning with AKT GROUP LLC’s goal of preventing financial distress.

🛠️ Technical Features
Bilingual Interface: Toggle between English and French to serve the diverse Francophone and Anglophone immigrant communities.

Event Tracker: Specialized ledger for tracking revenue, hosts, and expenses for community outreach events.

Data Portability: Export full transaction history and event logs to CSV (Excel) or PDF for tax preparation or loan applications.

Zero-Cloud Privacy: Uses LocalStorage to keep all business data stored privately on the owner's device.

📋 How to Use

Set Up: Use the "Sales" card to add your signature dishes to the permanent menu for faster checkout.

Log Daily: Record bulk purchases as "Expenses" (check the "Add to Stock" box) and daily revenue as "Sales."
